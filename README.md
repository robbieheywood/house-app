## HouseApp

A simple app for displaying useful household information.

Note: this app is a vehicle for me to practice with new technologies - 
it is definitely NOT the best implementation for this and is deliberately very over-engineered.

TODO:
* Fix build
* Use SQL builder
* Sort gcloud auth (gcloud auth application-default login)
* Move to go-cloud
* Sort rollout with env variables
* DB allows capitals
* Cloud function acts on database
* House server talks to auth server
* k8s-ize Go backend
* Something in Java
* Front end
* Add redis, nginx
* Allow moving to AWS
